### About Myself:

I've started my educataion as a web-developer in December 2020. Before I've tried to find myself in programming microcontrollers, but it wasn't interesting for me. My growing interest in programming led me to enter the master's program in software engineering at MIET. And now I'm first year student.

My study as web-developer began with observing my friends who were doing their pet-project. That was very interesting and something new for me, so I decedid to begin learning *HTML5*, *CSS3* and *Sass*. After that I started studying *JS* and *Vue.js*, because they were developing their project with Vue. During my education I made some learning projects on Vue. Also, now I'm learning *Nuxt.js* to make Vue.js applications more powerful.

Since childhood, I have an interest in languages. That's why I started learning English in school and resumed it in my university, where I got qualification of Translator and Interpreter. In addition, I started studying Spanish, just because I want.
### Skills:
* HTML5, CSS3, Sass
* JavaScript, Vue.js, Nuxt.js

### Code Example:
**Jaden Casing Strings KATA from CODEWARS:** *Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.*

*Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.*
```
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function (str = "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real") {
 return str
    .split(" ")
    .map((word) => word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
    .join(" ");
};
```
