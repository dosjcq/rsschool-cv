### About Myself
I've started my educataion as a web-developer in December 2020. Before I've tried to find myself in programming microcontrollers, but it wasn't interesting for me. My growing interest in programming led me to enter the master's program in software engineering at MIET. And now I'm first year student.

My study as web-developer began with observing my friends who were doing their pet-project. That was very interesting and something new for me, so I decedid to begin learning *HTML5*, *CSS3* and *Sass*. After that I started studying *JS* and *Vue.js*, because they were developing their project with Vue. During my education I made some learning projects on Vue. Also, now I'm learning *Nuxt.js* to make Vue.js applications more powerful.

Since childhood, I have an interest in languages. That's why I started learning English in school and resumed it in my university, where I got qualification of Translator and Interpreter. In addition, I started studying Spanish, just because I want.
